# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors game from the odin project

in this project I learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

also practiced using logic like if statements to solve some of the game problems like determining a winner of each round and the overall result of the game.

got a bit more familiar with media queries.
